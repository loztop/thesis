\section{Conclusion}
The local pressure jump stabilization method \cite{burman2007unified} is commonly used to solve the Stokes or Darcy equations using piecewise linear approximations for the velocities, and piecewise constant approximations for the pressure variable. The main contribution of this chapter has been to extend these ideas to three-field poroelasticity. We have presented a stability result for the discretized equations that guarantees the existence of a unique solution at each time step, and derived an energy estimate which can be used to prove weak convergence of the solution to the discretized system to the solution to the continuous problem as the mesh parameters tend to zero. We also derived an optimal error estimate which includes an error for the fluid flux in its natural $H{div}$ norm. We have also presented numerical experiments in 2D and 3D that illustrate the convergence of the method, the effectiveness of the method in overcoming spurious pressure oscillations, and the added mass effect of the stabilization term.
