\section{Introduction}
In chapter \ref{chap:linear_poro}, we developed a stabilized, low-order, mixed finite-element method for the fully saturated, incompressible, poroelasticity equations, in the linear, small deformation case. In this chapter we extend this work to the nonlinear, large deformation case.

In section \ref{sec:large_model}, we recall the large deformation quasi-static incompressible poroelastic model. In section \ref{sec:fem} we present the stabilized nonlinear finite-element method, and provide some implementation details in section \ref{sec:implementation}. In section \ref{sec:results}, we present a range of 3D  numerical experiments to verify the accuracy of the method and illustrate its ability to reliably capture steep pressure gradients.
