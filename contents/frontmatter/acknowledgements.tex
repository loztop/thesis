\textbf{\large Acknowledgments}
\end{center}
My biggest thanks goes out to my supervisors. Dr. David Kay is a living legend. His enthusiasm, energy and kindness have made my time in Oxford very enjoyable. Not only has he given up countless hours to build my mathematical understanding but also acted as a great football and life coach. I am also indebted to Dr. Rafel Bordas who has guided me through the Dphil and been a constant source of ideas and support. I would also like to express my appreciation for Professor Simon Tavener who gave me a great amount of his time and attention, all the way from Colorado. I would like to thank Dr. Kelly Burrowes for getting me excited about lungs, and Professor Vicente Grau for introducing me to this project. I am also thankful to my Transfer and Confirmation examiners Dr. Jonathen Whitley and Professor Kevin Burrage for providing detailed feedback and suggestions that have shaped much of this thesis. 

For all the great company I would like to thank all my friends at the Computational Biology group, the DTC and Keble college. Also thanks to the Redemption crew for putting things into context and always keeping me frothing for the next trip. Finally, I'd like to thank my family in Swansea and Bavaria for their love and support throughout.
